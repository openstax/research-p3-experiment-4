    This is the second part to a two-part study on "Digital Logic".
    You completed the first part of the study about an hour ago.
</p>
<p>
    In Part 1 of the study, you read a text on digital logic and
    answered questions. In this part of the study, you will again
    answer questions in order to assess how much of the information you
    retained from Part 1.
</p>
<p>
    Before beginning the assessment you will play a game for
    5 minutes. After 5 minutes you will be taken to the next
    part of the assessment.
</p>
<p>
    Do your best to answer as many questions as accurately as you can.
    The study will automatically end when you have answered all the
    questions or you have exceeded an hour. This is
    intended to be a "closed book" exercise. Please do not refer to the
    text, notes, or any external resources while answering the
    questions. However, some questions may require you to work out the
    solution on paper &mdash; this is permitted.
</p>
<p>
    While the study is time limited, please note the following:
<p>
    The study benefits immensely from thoughtful, worked-out responses
    that reflect your understanding of the subject matter. Please avoid
    submitting random responses for the purpose of answering all the
    questions in the allotted time &mdash; answering all the questions
    is not required for payment.
</p>
</p>
<p>
    You may quit the study at any time, for any reason.
