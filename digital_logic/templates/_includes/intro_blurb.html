  In this study, you will first read a brief introductory chapter on
  "Digital Logic."  You may read the chapter at your own pace, but
  <strong>you must spend between 10 and 30 minutes reading the text</strong>.
  Make sure you have a good understanding before moving on (i.e., do
  not skim).  You may take notes while you read, but please discard
  the notes when you are finished. After reading the chapter, you
  will answer multiple choice questions from the text.
</p>

<p>
  Do your best to answer as many questions as accurately as you can.
  The study will automatically end when you have answered all the
  questions or you have exceeded an hour.  This is
  intended to be a "closed book" exercise. Please do not refer to the
  text, notes, or any external resources while answering the
  questions.  However, some questions may require you to work out the
  solution on paper &mdash; this is permitted.

<p>
  While the study is time limited, please note the following:
  <p>
    The study benefits immensely from thoughtful, worked-out responses
    that reflect your understanding of the subject matter.  Please avoid
    submitting random responses for the purpose of answering all the
    questions in the allotted time &mdash; answering all the questions
    is not required for payment.

  You may quit the study at any time, for any reason.
